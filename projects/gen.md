Inspired by E/H-field diagrams and built using numpy and pycairo. This project draws a visually pleasing representation of the magnetic field created by randomly placed infinite current-carrying wires extending out of the canvas.

This project draws something pretty similar to the [color blindness test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishihara_test) everyone knows and loves. Instead of packing circles into a larger circle, it packs them randomly into a mask rendered from an input string. It can also output images as SVG files suitable for use with a plotter or laser cutter.
