# mntn.dev reskin
This is a home-spun successor to the current mntn.dev design.

mntn.dev was originally made using jekyll and a thoroughly modified copy of the minima theme. To get a better handle on React and modern CSS, I'm rebuilding the site from scratch starting with the react-static.

# Usage
To host:
```bash
$ yarn run start
```

To build:
```bash
$ yarn run build
```
